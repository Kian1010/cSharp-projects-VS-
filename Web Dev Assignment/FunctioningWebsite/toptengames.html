                    Dark Souls III is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective,<br> 
                    similar to previous games in the series.<br> 
                    According to lead director and series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki,<br> 
                    the game's gameplay design followed "closely from Dark Souls II".<br> 
                    Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, <br>
                    such as bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. <br>
                    Shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks<br>
                     and protect the player from suffering damage.

                   a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena <br>
                   that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (voiced by Courtney Hope), <br>

                    in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. <br>
                    The player gains abilities by finding Objects of Power, <br>
                    mundane objects like a rotary phone or a floppy disc imbued with energies <br>
                    from another dimension, that have been at the center of major paranormal events <br>
                    and since recovered by the FBC.<br></p>

                    and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of several environmental spaces.<br>
                     If successful, the player is rewarded through loot consisting of parts from the monster <br>

                     The game's core loop has the player crafting appropriate gear to be able to hunt down <br>

                     Players may hunt alone or in a group of up to four players via the game's online multiplayer.
